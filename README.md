# Influence-maximization-on-hypergraphs
## About


An adaptive degree-based algorithm, named HDD, which could effectively avoid node influence overlap is proposed, which is under a discrete-time susceptible-infected (SI) spreading dynamics. In detail, we validate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed algorithm on both hypergraphs generated by real-world data and hypergraph generation model. We further explore the robustness of our method over the change of degree heterogeneity on synthetic hypergraphs.
